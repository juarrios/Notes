  Characteristics
    Scalability
      ability to allocate and deallocate resources at any time
      Vertical
        Related to a resource size
        Scaling Up
          Increase size, adding more power
            CPU
            Memory
            Storage
        Scaling Down
          Decrease size
      Horizontal
        Related to amount of resources
        Scaling Out
          adding amount of resources
        Scaling In
          removing amount of resources
    Elasticity
      ability to scale dynamically
      automatic scaling
      ability to add or remove resources depending on work load
    Agility

      Metric that measures how much uptime of the system
        uptime / (uptime + downtime )
        99%     = 3.65 days / year
        99.9%   = 8.77 hours / year
        99.99%  = 52.6 minutes / year

Episode 38
Azure Service Level Agreement (SLA)
  Formal agreement between Microsoft and the customer
    SLA is a promise of a service's availability (uptime & connectivity) per month
    availability is a measure of time that a service remains operational
    each service has its own SLA
    ranges from 99% to 99.999%
  Calculated as a percentage of service availability
    Breaking the SQL provides a discount from the final monthly bill ( service credit )
  Higher tier services offer better SLAs
  Free services typically have no SLA (0% SLA)
  Preview services have no SLA
  Composite SLA is a combined SLA of all application components
    Logical AND
      adding dependency
      Multiply availability SLAs to get composite SLA
    Logical OR
      adding redundancy
      100% - (Unvailability(S1)*Unvailability(S2)) to get composite SLA
