    Not fully interchangeable
    
2) Set Up the Environment
  Install Node.JS
    Download from https://nodejs.org
    Node version Manager allows to switch between Node versions
  Set up system for Android development for Mac
    Need Java SDK (SE Development Kit)
      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads
    Android SDK
      https://developer.android.com/studio/
      Just download the CLI tools
      Unzip file and place it in a "Development" folder
    Tell command line where these tools live:
      Setup path in ~/.bash_profile
        export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/juarrios/Development/android-sdk-macosx/
        export PATH=${PATH}:/Users/juarrios/Development/android-sdk-macosx/
        platform-to ols:/Users/juarrios/Development/android-sdk-macosx/tools
    Download SDK components for Android
      In CLI
        >android
      Select packages and install
        
        
  Set up system for Android development for PC
    Need Java SDK (SE Development Kit)
      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads
    Android SDK
      https://developer.android.com/studio/
