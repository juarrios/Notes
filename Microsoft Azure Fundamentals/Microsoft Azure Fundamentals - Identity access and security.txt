Microsfot Entra ID
  Cloud-based identity and access management service available globally
  Can detect sign-in attempts from unexpected locations or unknown devices
  What can id do
    Authentication
      Verifying identity to access applications and resources
      Self-service password reset
      multifactor authentication
      smart lockout services
    Single sign-on
      enables to remember only one username and one password
      reduces effor to change or disable accounts
    Application management
      Application Proxy, Saas, My Apps portal
    Device management
      registration of devices
      managed through tools like Microsoft Intune
      Conditional Access policies to restrict accesss attempts
  Microsoft Entra Connect
    synchronizes user identities between on-premise AD and Entra ID
  Micfosoft Entra Domain Services
    provides managed domain services
      domain join
      group policy
      LDAP
      Kerveros/NTLM authentication
    How does it work
      You define a namespace which is your domain name
      Two domain controllers are deployed in your selected Azure region known as replica set
      Azure platform handles DCs management

Authentication methods
  Authentication is the process of establishing the identity of a person, services, or device
  It just proves who you are
  Single Sign-on
    enables user to sign in one time and use that credential to access multiple resources and applicaitons
  Multifactor authentication
    is the process of prompting a user for an extra form of identification during the sign-in process
    three categories
      something the user knows
      something the user has
      something the user is, like a biometric property
    Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication
      service that provides multifactor authetication capabilities
    Passwordless authentication
      password is removed and replaced with somthing you have, plus something you are, or something you know.
      example: your computer and a PIN or fingerprint
      Azure offer the following three passwordless authentication
        Windows Hello for Business
          for workers with own designated Windows PC and their biometric and PIN credentials
        Microsoft Authenticator app
          matching a number displayed on screen with one on their phone
          using their biometric or PIN to confirm
        FIDO2 security keys
          FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) is an open standard for passwordless authentication
          By using an external security key or a platform key built into a device
          A hardware device that handles the authentication
          Typically USB devices but can be Bluetooth or NFC

Azure external identities
  a person, device, service, etc. that is outside your organization
  ways you can securely interact with users outside of your organization
  external users can bring their own identities
    external user's identity provider manages their identity
    Microsoft Entra ID or Azure AD B2C manages access to your apps and resources
  External identity capabilities
    Business to business (B2B) 
      let external users use their preferred identity to sign-in 
      represented as guest users
    B2B direct connect
      mutual two-way trust with another Microsoft Entra organization
      supports Teams shared channels
      visible within Teams shared channels and can be monitored in Teams admin center reports
    Business to customer (B2C)
      publish SaaS or custom-developed apps (non-Microsoft) to consumers and customers
  
Azure conditional access
  allow access to resources based on identity signals
    who the user is
    where the user is
    what device is requesting from
    what application is trying to access
  user might no be challenged if present at a known location
  might be challenged for second authentication if signal is unusual or unexpected location
  When conditional access is useful
    MFA for administrators but not regular users or connecting outside network
    access to services only thorugh approved client applications
    access to applications only from managed devices that meets your standards for security and compliance
    block access from utrusted sources like unknown or unexpected locations
    
Azure role-based access control
  Principle of least privilege
    only grant access up to the level needed to complete a task
  Control access through Azure role-based access control (RBAC) which are hierarchical
  Azure provides built-in roles for common access rules for cloud resources
  can define own roles
  Role-based access control for resources
    Management group
    Single subscription
    Resource group
    Single resource
  Resource Manager
    management service to organize and secure cloud resources
    accessile through Azure portal, Azure Cloud Shell, PowerShell and Azure CLI
    doesn't enforce application security which is handled by application
  Zero trust model
    security model that assumes the worst case scenario and protects resources
    verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network
    guiding principles
      verify explicitly
        always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
      least privilege access
        user access to Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA)
      assume breach
        minimize blast radius and segment access
        verify end-to-end encryption
        use analytics for visibility, threat detection and improve defenses
  Adjust to zero trust
    instead of assuming a device is safe because within network, require everyone to authenticate
    protect assets anywhere with central policy
  
Defense-in-depth
  to protect information and prevent it from being stolen by unauthorized users
  uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advance of an attack
  removes reliance on any single layer of protection
  Layers
    Physical security
      first line of defense
    Identity & Access
      controls access only to infrastructure needed and change control logged
      use SSO and MFA
      Audit event and changes
    Perimeter
      uses distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection
      firewalls to identify and alert on malicious attacks
    Network
      limits communication between resources through segmentation and access controls
      deny by default
      restrict inbound internet and outbound access
      implement secure connectivity to on-premises network
    Compute     
      secures access to VMs
      implement endpoint protection on devices
      keep systems patched and current
    Application
      ensure applications are secure and free of vulnerabilities
      store sensitive secrets in secure storage medium
      make security a design requirement
    Data
      controls access to data in
        database data
        VM disk data
        SaaS application data
      managed through cloud storage
  
Microsoft Defender for Cloud
  Is a monitoring tool for cloud security posture management (CSPM) and threat protection
  provides tools to harden your resources, track security posture, protect cyber attacks and streamline security management
  natively integrated to Azure
  Azure-native protections
    Azure Paas services
      detect threats targeting Azure services
      anomaly detection on Azure activity logs
    Azure data services
      automatically classify data in Azure SQL
      assessments for potential vulnerabilities across SQL and Storage services and recommendations
    Networks
      limit exposure to brute force attacks
      reducing access to VM ports
      secure access policies on selected ports only for authorized users
      allow source IP addresses
      limited amount of time
  Defend hybrid resources
    can add Defender for Cloud to hybrid cloud environment to protect non-Azure servers
  Defend resources running on other clouds
    Can also protect resources in other clouds like AWS and GCP
      CSPM features extend to AWS resources
      Defender for Containers in EKS Linux clusters
      Defender for Servers in Windows and EC2 instances

Assess, Secure, and Defend
  Three vital needs for security
    continuosly assess
      know you security posture, identify and track vulnerabilities
      regular, detailed vulnerability scans that cover compute, data and infrastructure
    secure
      harden resources and services with Azure Security Benchmark
      security policies in place that are tailored to your environment and situation
      apply secure configuration standards across your resources
      secure score values for each control as an indicator of security posture health
    defend
      detect and resolve threats to resources, workloads and services
  security alerts
    describe details of the affected resources
    suggest remediation steps
    provide an option to trigger a logic app in response
