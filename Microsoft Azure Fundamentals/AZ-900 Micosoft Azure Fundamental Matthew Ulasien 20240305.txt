  Azure Portal
    Most common way to interact with Azure
    a website gives you access to all your resources and features
    can build, manage and monitor everything in a single unified console
    Portal featurs
      Personalize
        craete own dashboards, layouts, workflows and colors
      Access control
        fine-grained to all resources to make management and governance much easier
      Cost management
        to keep track of current and projected spend of Azure resources
      One stop shop
        single portal, single login for all Azure assets
      Constantly updated
        featurs and products constantly updated
      Multi-platform
        available through the web and mobile devices      
  Azure CLI
    Text only entry tool
    same result as using the portal
    Advantages
      Stable
        text commands don't change
      Structure
        CLI commands structured logically and follow same pattern
      Croos platform
        Works on Windows, Mac and Linux
      Automation
        simple to automate the CLI commands for future use
      Logging
        keep track of who ran what command and when in various ways
      
  Azure PowerShell
    Uses cmdlets
    Example how to create a new virtual machine
      >new-az vm nameOfMachine
    Can manipulate resources   
  Azure Cloud shell

    Goal of giving quick information
    excelent to quickly diagnose and fix issues on the go
    hs a version of Cloud Shell to run PowerShell or Azure CLI commands
  ARM Templates
    give options to automate and replicate tasks
    Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is gatekeeper to manage anything in Azure
    templates
      describe resource usage
        a way to describe which resources to create, delete, manage or alter
        do any number of actions
      common syntax
        making it easier to formalize and learn
    benefits
      idempotent
        can be applied multiple times and results are always the same
      source control
        keep track of all changes
      reuse
        use a combination of multiple partial ARM templates to achieve
      declarative
        specify what you want, not how it is done
      no human errors
        automation means don't repeat mistakes      
  Azure Advisor
    provide recommendation to 
      improve availability of resources

      need to provide a valid credit card
      it will open with "Quickstart Center"
      
Cloud Concepts
  Cloud computing
    On-demand availability of computer system resources split into three main catories
      compute
      networking
      storage
    cloud are datacenters distributed around the globe
    benefits
      low cost
      ease of adoption
      almost unlimited resources
  Language terms
    High Availability
      systems are always available
      if hardware fails it is replaced instantly
      use clusters to ensure high availability
    Reliability
      how Azure can tolerate failures or even disasters
      ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
      aka fault tolerance / disaster recovery
      use to describe the resilience of cloud computing
      two strategies
        deploy in multiple locations
          global scale computing
          protect agains regional failure/disaster
        no single point of failure
          resources in multiple locations
          if one computer goes down, others pick up the load         
    Scalability
      process of adding more resources on an as-needed basis
      automatically adjust resources to meet demand
        example adding number of VMs to handle peak traffic
      automatically reduce resources when demand drops
        remove uneeded VMs
        don't overpay for services
      Horizontal = scaling out
        adding additional VMs/containers
      Vertical = scaling up
        increase power (CPU/RAM) of existing VMs
    Predictability
      application will always perform as expected and knowing what it will cost
      Performance
        consistent experience for customers regardless of traffic
        autoscaling, load balancing and high availability provide a consistent experience
      Costs
        no unexpected surprises
        track and forecast resource usage (costs) in real time
        analytics provide patterns/trends to optimize usage
    Security
      full control of cloud environment
        patches, maintenance, network control
    Governance
      standarize environments to corporate standars
      regulatory requirements
      audit for compliance
    Manageabiity
      management of the cloud resources
        autoscaling
        monitoring
        ARM templated based deployments
      management in the cloud
        how to interact with resources
          portal
          cli
          APIs
  Economy of Cloud Computing
    Capital Expenditure
      money spent on acquiring or maintainig fixed assets as land, buildings and equipment
      large upfront investments
    Operational Expenditure
      ongoing cost of running a product, business or system on a day-to-day basis, including annual costs
      pay-as-you-go     
    Azure pricing
      Hourly pricing
      Consumption based
        pay for resources used
        per execution of function
        per second
        or combination of both
        no lock-in fees
