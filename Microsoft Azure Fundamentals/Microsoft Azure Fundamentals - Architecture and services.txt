Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe Azure architecture and services 12/21/2023
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/azure-fundamentals-describe-azure-architecture-services/

What is Microsoft Azure
  Provides more than 100 services
    Applictions, AI, ML
Azure accounts
  To create and use Azure services an Azure subscription is needed.
  Need an Azure account to create a subscription. 
    Azure Account -> Subscriptions -> Resource Groups -> Resources
  Azure Free Account
    access to 20 products for 12 months and $200 credit for 30 days
    Access to more than 25 products always free

    Temporary subscription added to Azure account
    Preferred because allows to create and test Azure resources at no cost.

  PowerShell CLI
    >Get-Date
    >az version
      { 
        "azure-cli": "2.55.0",
        "azure-cli-core": "2.55.0",
        "azure-cli-telemetry": "1.1.0",
        "extensions": {
          "ai-examples": "0.2.5",
          "ml": "2.22.0",
          "ssh": "2.0.2"
        }
      }
  Bash CLI
    >bash
    >az upgrade
    >pwsh
      PowerShell 7.4.0
  Azure CLI Interactive
    Closely resembles an IDE
    Provides autocompletion, command descriptions and examples
    Same "az" commands but without the "az " prefix
    >az interactive
      >version
      >upgrade
      >exit
  Azure Portal
    Web portal to see all the services Azure has to offer
    
Physical Infrastructure
  Datacenter grouped into Azure Regions or Availability Zones
  https://datacenters.microsoft.com/
  Regions
    Geographical area on the planet with at least one datacenters
    Potentially multiple datacenters networked together with low-latency
  Availability Zones
    Physically separate datacenters within a Region
    Set up to be an isolation boundary
    If one zone goes down the others continue working
    A minimum of 3 per Region for resiliency
    Categories
      Zonal services
        Pin resources to a specific zone
      Zone-redundant services
        platform replicates automatically across zones
      Non-regional services
        always available and resilient to zone-wide and region-wide outages
  Region pairs
    Region paired with another region at least 300 miles away
    Allows for replication of resources
    In case of region outage service automatically fail over to other region
  Sovereign Regions
    Regions isolated from main instance of Azure for compliance or legal purposes.
    Mostly goverment regions
Management Infrastructure
  Azure resources and resouce groups
    Resource is basic building block
    Resource group is grouping of resources
    All resources must be created within a group
    Resource groups can not be nested
  Azure subscriptions
    Unit of management, billing and scale
    Logically organize resource groups for billing and links to an Azure account
    Provides authenticated and authorized access to products and services
    Billing boundary
      Azure generates separate billing report and invoice per subscription to manage costs
    Accesss control boundary
      Access management policies at the subscription level
      Example is business with different departments have different policies
  Azure management groups
    Are subscription containers to apply governance conditions
    Give enterprise-grade management at a large scale and they can be nested
    Create a hierarchy that applies a policy
    Provide user access to multiple subscription
      Azure role-based access control (RBAC)
    Facts
      Up to 10K mgmt groups in a single directory
      Mgmt group tree up to six levels of depth not including root
      each mgmt group can support only one parent
  Excercise - Create Azure virtual machine
    Create a Resource -> Compute -> Virtual Machine -> Create
    Enter pane basic information
      Subscription, Resource group, Machine name, authentication type, usermane, password
    Review seven resources created
      Storage account, virtual machine, Public IP address, Network security group,
      Virtual Network, Network Interface, Disk
