    tools
      Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator
        to estimate cost savings by migrating application workloads to Azure
      Azure Pricing Calculator
        estimate expected monthly bill
      Microsoft Cost Management + Billing
        use and manage Azure and other cloud resources
  Define business justification
    Common cloud computing business value areas
      Cost
        Eliminate capital expense
      Scale
        delivering the rigth amount of IT resources
      Productivity
        remove need of many IT management chores
      Reliability
        eases burden of data backup, disaster recovery and business continuity
    
Plan
  Rationalize digital state
    understand current digital state to maximize return and minimize risks by running a workload assessment
    inventory all digital assests and evaluate each to determine best way to migrate or modernize each component to the cloud
    proceed incrementally
    Five Rs options 
      Rehost
        AKA lift-and-shift migration
        moves current asset to the chosen cloud provider
        minimal change to overall architecture
        Outcome
          reduce capital expense
          free up datacenter space
          rapid ROM in the cloud
      Refactor
        application development process of refactoring to deliver on new business opportunities
        Outcome
          experience faster and shorter updates
          benefit from code portability
          greater cloud efficiency in the areas of resources, speed, cost
      Rearchitect
        if application not compatible with the cloud
        to produce cost and operational efficiencies in the cloud
        Outcome
          gain application scale and agility
          adopt new cloud capabilities more easily
          use a mix of technology stacks
      Rebuild/New
        a new code base with a cloud-native design might be the most appropriate and efficient path
        Outcome
          accelerate innovation
          build applications faster
          reduce operational cost
      Replace
        replace current application with a hosted application that meets all functionality required in the cloud
        Outcome
          standardize around industry best practices
          accelerate adoption of business process-driven approches
          reallocate development investments 
  Create cloud adoption plan
    prioritize workloads defined and aligned with business outcomes
    key steps
      review sample business outcomes
      identify leading metrics that best represent progress toward identified business outcomes
      establish financial model that aligns with outcomes and leading metrics

Ready
  Define skills and support readiness
    address current gaps
    ensure IT and business people are ready for the change and the new technologies
    define support needs
    Azure readiness guide
      help you organize resources, control costs, and secure and manage your organization
  Create your landing zone
    set up a migration target in the cloud to handle prioritized applications
    a safe place for your environment and ready to be monitored
    an environment provisioned and prepared to host workloads in the cloud
    Resources include
      management groups
      resource groups
      subscriptions
      
Adopt
  Migration
    Moving existing assests to a cloud platform with minimal modifications
    fastest and most agile in short term
    benefits of cloud might not be realized without additional future modifications
  Innovation
    cloud-native applications and data accelerate development and experimentation cycles
    DevOps shorten the time from idea to product transformation
    shorter feedback loops and better customer experience
    
Govern and manage
  adopting the cloud is a journey, not a destination
  Define governance solutions
    Governance
      understanding business risks that may be faced when moving into the cloud
      can be mitigating by documenting any business risk
      convert risk decisions into policies
      process in place to monitor policy violations
    meet organization's business needs, provide agility and control risks
    creates guardrails to keep organization on a safe path
    Disciplines of Cloud Governance
      Cost Management
        who is accountable
        how much to spend
        who will add new elements to be paid for
      Security Baseline
        make sure covering all security aspects related to the project
      Resource Consistency
        reduces number of operational tasks to deal with
      Identity Baseline
        who has access to resources to enable them to do exactly what they need to do in the cloud environment
      Deployment Acceleration
        provisioning new resources is easy as a production line
