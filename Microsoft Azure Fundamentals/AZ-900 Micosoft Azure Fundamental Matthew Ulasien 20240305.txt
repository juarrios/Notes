Cloud Concepts
  Cloud computing
    On-demand availability of computer system resources split into three main catories
      compute
      networking
      storage
    cloud are datacenters distributed around the globe
    benefits
      low cost
      ease of adoption
      almost unlimited resources
  Language terms
    High Availability
      systems are always available
      if hardware fails it is replaced instantly
      use clusters to ensure high availability
    Reliability
      how Azure can tolerate failures or even disasters
      ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
      aka fault tolerance / disaster recovery
      use to describe the resilience of cloud computing
      two strategies
        deploy in multiple locations
          global scale computing
          protect agains regional failure/disaster
        no single point of failure
          resources in multiple locations
          if one computer goes down, others pick up the load         
    Scalability
      process of adding more resources on an as-needed basis
      automatically adjust resources to meet demand
        example adding number of VMs to handle peak traffic
      automatically reduce resources when demand drops
        remove uneeded VMs
        don't overpay for services
      Horizontal = scaling out
        adding additional VMs/containers
      Vertical = scaling up
        increase power (CPU/RAM) of existing VMs
    Predictability
      application will always perform as expected and knowing what it will cost
      Performance
        consistent experience for customers regardless of traffic
        autoscaling, load balancing and high availability provide a consistent experience
      Costs
        no unexpected surprises
        track and forecast resource usage (costs) in real time
        analytics provide patterns/trends to optimize usage
    Security
      full control of cloud environment
        patches, maintenance, network control
    Governance
      standarize environments to corporate standars
      regulatory requirements
      audit for compliance

      Tunnel, a secure connection with encryption
      On-premise network with a complementary gateway that accepts encrypted data
    instrumental in a hybrid cloud architecture  
  Application Gateway

Authentication and Authorization
  Identity Services
    Authentication
      Making sure you are you
      Confirmint identity
      first test for access
    Authorization
      comes after authentication
      granular part of identity services
  Azure Active Directory (AAD)
    Main tool to manage users and permissions
    Not same as on-premise AD
    Mandatory
      Can't have an Azure account without an ADD service
    First User
      Is the initial ADD instance
    Tenant
      represents your organization
      tenant is a dedicated instance of AAD that a organization receives when signing up for Azure
      saparate and distinct from other ADD tenants
      a user can be a member or guest of up to 500 AAD tenants
    Subscription
      billing entity
        all resources withing a subscription are billed together
      cost separation
        multiple subscriptions within a tenant to separate costs
      payment
        all resources and services stopped if subscription is not paid   
  Zero Trust Concepts
    All users assumed untrustworthy unless proven otherwise
    trusted by identity, not location
    least privilege access
      just enough permissions to perform job
    simplified, centrilized management (AAD)
    can have conditional access policies
    allow access from approved managed devices   
  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
    Using more than one form of authentication
    Approach
      Something you know
        user name and password
      Something you have
        phone or key fob
      Something you are
        fingerprint or retina scan, biometircs
    MFA enabled through AAD    
  Conditional Access
    Using if/then policy to grant access
      meet conditions to grant or block access to defined applications
    Often paired with MFA
    Assign conditions
      users/groups
      application grant/deny access
      location (IP)
      approved devices
    Access decisions
      grant
      block
      require MFA
  Passwordless Authentication
    Security vs Convenience conflict
    increase the convenience of logging while still staying secure
    remove password form system login
    replace with
      something you have
      something you know/are
    Methods
      Microsoft authenticator app
      Windows Hello
      FIDO2 Security Key
  External Guest Access
    adding a guest user
      invite using a variety of account types
        identity providers like Microsoft, Google, Facebook
      assign permissions for guest account
        principle of least privilege
        different between AAD and Azure subscription
      Optional
        assing guest user to application
        apply cross-tenant
        conditional access policy
          MFA
          approved devices     
  Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AAD DS)
    Used to migrate legacy applications (that don't use OAuth 2.0) to the cloud
