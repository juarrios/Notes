I just bought the Commercial 14.9 Elliptical, yesterday I finished the assembly. I have 3 questions:

1) Your website says that there is a one year iFit free membership but I could not find the access code in the included documentation. Can I please have an access code for this one year free membership?

2) the EKG grip does not seems to be working. I grab the handles for more than 15 seconds but I never see the heart rate in the screen. What can I double check to fix it?

3)  The right hand mobil handle did not come with the +/- buttons and the internal wire to connect and adjust the resistance, as indicated in the documentation manual. Could I have a handle with these missing buttons?
