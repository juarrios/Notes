Azure Virtual Machines
  Provide IaaS that can be customized for software to run
  Ideal for
    Total control over OS
    Ability to run custom software
    Use custom hosting configurations
  Customer responsible to configure, update and maintain the software
  Can be created in minutes when using preconfigured VM image
  Image is a template that already includes OS and other software
Scale VMs in Azure
  Grouping VMs together for high availability, scalability and redundancy
  Virtual machine scale sets
    Allows to centrally manage, configure and update a large number of VMs in minutes
    Number of VMs can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or schedule
    Automatically deploy a load balancer for resource efficiency
    Allow to build large-scale services for compute, big data and container workloads
  Virtual machine availability sets
    Ensure that VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity
    Prevent from losing all VMs in a single network or power failure
    Update domain
      Group VMs can be rebooted one domain group at a time. 
      A 30-minute recover time before moving to next domain update.
    Fault domain
      Groups by common power source and network switch.
      Availability set split VMs into three fault domains.
      Only pay for VM instances created.
  Examples when to use VMs 
    During testing and development
    When running applications in the cloud
    When extending local datacenter to the cloud
    During disaster recovery
      Using IaaS based approach to disaster recovery.
  Move to the cloud with VMs
    AKA "lift and shift" by creating an image of on premise physical server and hosting VM in cloud
    Customer still is responsible for maintaining to installation
  VM Resources
    Size: processor cores and amount of RAM
    Storage: hard disk drives or solid state drives
    Networking: virtual network, public IP address, port configuration
  Task 1: Create a Linux VM and install Nginx using CLI
    >az vm create --resource-group learn-5e17ad5b-8216-4c26-be6d-3543c8a77144 \
                  --name my-vm --public-ip-sku Standard --image Ubuntu2204 \
                  --admin-username azureuser --generate-ssh-keys   
    Use extension to configure Nginx
    >az vm extension set --resource-group learn-5e17ad5b-8216-4c26-be6d-3543c8a77144 \
                         --vm-name my-vm --name customScript --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Extensions \
                         --version 2.1 \
                         --settings '{"fileUris":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-welcome-to-azure/master/configure-nginx.sh"]}' \
                         --protected-settings '{"commandToExecute": "./configure-nginx.sh"}'
    Script runs these bash commands:                     
      #!/bin/bash
      # Update apt cache.
      sudo apt-get update
      # Install Nginx.
      sudo apt-get install -y nginx
      # Set the home page.
      echo "<html><body><h2>Welcome to Azure! My name is $(hostname).</h2></body></html>" | sudo tee -a /var/www/html/index.html    
Azure Virtual desktop
  A desktop and application virtualization service running ont the cloud.
  A cloud-hosted version of Windows
  Works across devices and OSes to access remote desktops and on browsers.
  Enhance security
    Provides centrilized security management with Entra ID
    Can enable multifactor authentication
    RBAC to secure data access
    Data and Apps separated from local hardware running in the cloud
    User sesssions are isolated
  Multi-session on Windows 10 or 11 deployment
    Enables multiple concurrent users on a single VM
    Provids a more consistent experience
Azure Containers
  An application and its dependencies inside a container host.
  Allow to run multiple instances of an application in a single machine
  Lightweight more agile designed to be created, scaled out and stopped dynamically
  Docker is most popular engine
  VMs virtualize the hardware vs Containers virtualize the OS
  Faster to start since just waiting for App to launch and not OS to start
  Better portability and performance
  Cluster Orchestration
    Deploy and manage multiple containerized applications
    No worry about which server will host each container
  Azure Container Instances
    Fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure
    Is a PaaS offering
    Allows to upload containers and service will run them.
  Azure container Apps
    Has extra benefits like load balancing and scaling
  Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)
    A container orchestration service
    Manages the lifecycle of a fleet of containers
    Management is simpler and more efficient
  Use containers in your solutions
    Used to create solutions with microservice architecture
    Breaking solutions into smaller independent pieces
    That can be maintained, scaled and updated independently.
Azure Functions
  Event-driven, serverless compute
  An event wakes the function, alleviating the need to keep resources provisioned when there are no events
  Abstraction of servers to not worry about infrasctructure and focus on application development
  Benefits
    No infrastructure management
      You only upload the code
    Scalability
      Scales automatically without any configuration
    Only pay for what is used
      Resource only allocated from a direct action
        REST request, timer or message
        work is completed quickly, within seconds or less
      Pay only for time it takes to run the code
        Only charged by CPU time used while function runs
  Functions
    Stateless
      Behave as restarted every time to respond to an event
    Stateful
      AKA Durable functions
      A context is passed to track prior activity

    public: have public IP accessed from anywhere
    private: within a virtual network with private IP within that address space
  Provides
    Isolation and segmentation
      allows to create multiple isolated virtual networks
      virtual network defines a private IP address space
      IP range only exists within and can be divided into subnets
      Name resolution service build into Azure or can use an external DNS server
    Internet communication
      enable incoming internet connections by assigning a public IP to a resource or a load balancer
