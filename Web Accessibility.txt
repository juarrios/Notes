  What is an Accessible Site
    Content is available to everyone
    Functionality can be operated by everyone
  Developer's bad assumptions
    Everyone can use a mouse
    Everyone can swipe
    Everyone can see the interface
    Creates experience for a narrow range of people
  Accessibility
    People who's access or experience is different
    Contain some type of impediment or disability
    Makes no difference whether impediment is:
      Situational
      Temporary

    What actually matters is the user experience!
  Three main topics
    Focus
      Important for motor impairments
      Keyboard accessibility
    Semantics
      UI robust for assistive technology
    Styling and visual design
      UI flexible and usable as possible
      
Focus
  Refers to control that receives input from keyboard or clipboard
  Act of clicking or navigating to a textfield is what focus is
  Well implemented focus strategy will lead to a better experience
