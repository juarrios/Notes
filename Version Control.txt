Version Control (Carolyn Buckey, Sarah Spikes)

Introduction
  Giant undo button for project
  Easy to save different versions at different points in time
  Easier to collaborate with other people
    No more sending huge zip files back and forth
  
Differences
  Command line tools to compare:
    Windows: fc
      >fc /N game_old.js game_new.js
    Linux: diff
      >diff -u game_old.js game_new.js
Commits
  Snapshot of repository at the time of commit
  Recommended to do "one commit per logical change"
  Each commit has one purpose that is easily understood
Git
  Add color to diff command:
    >git config --global color.ui auto
HEAD
  The commit you are currently working on
  Can be detached to other pervious commits
Checkout
  Sort of restoring a previous version
  Resetting all files to how they were at the previous commit's time
  Helpful to revert and see when a new bug was not present
  
Git Cheat Sheet:

Detached HEAD:
  When looking at a commit that is not at the branch's tip

Show difference with parent node:
  >git show commitId
Aborting a merge
  >git merge --abort

Pulling:
  >git pull origin master, is this same as:
    >git fetch origin
    >git merge master origin/master
