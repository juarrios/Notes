1) Define your "user"
  Imagine that user and attach an imaginary persona.
  Beware, don't think of yourself or your friends with shared backgrounds and tastes.
  Expand your target user base beyond your preconceptions.

2) Create set of stories of iteractions between this persona and the app, your big wish list.
  Reduce to a subset of must-haves for the app to be successful:
    Minimum Viable Product
   
3) Get a team leader able to recruit and cover all technical angles to reach a cohesive whole.
