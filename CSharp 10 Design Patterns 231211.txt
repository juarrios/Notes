Design Pattern
  A general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
  View as a template to start from, but not as a rule
  Each pattern has an intent
    The intent should remain the same no matter how it is implemented
  Learn which problem each pattern solves

  Three Pattern types
    Creational
      Deal with object creation
      Abstract the object instantiation process
      Help making system independent of how objects are created, composed and represented.
      Five types
        Abstract Factory
        Builder
        Factory Method
        Prototype
        Singleton
    Structural
      Deal with ways to define relations between classes or objects
      Concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures
      Seven types
        Adapter
        Bridge
        Composite
        Decorator
        Facade
        Flyweight
        Proxy
    Behavioral
      Deal with ways to communicate between classes or objects
      Characterize complex control flow that's difficult to follow at runtime
      Let you concentrate on the way objects are interconnected
      Eleven types
        Chain of Responsibility
        Command
        Interpreter
        Iterator
        Mediator
        Memento
        Observer
        State
        Strategy
        Template Method
        Visitor
  Two Object oriented principles
    Program to an interface, not an implementation
      Clients 
        Only know about the interface
        Unaware of specific types being used
        Unaware of classes being implemented
      Implementation
        Use abstract class when needed to provide a basic functionality that can potentially be overriden
        Use interface if only need to specify the expected functionality of  class
      SOLID
        software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
    Favor object composition over class inheritance
      New functionality is obtained by assembling or composing objects
      
Singleton Pattern
  Creational pattern
  Ensure that a class only hs one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
    Example: a logger
  Make the class responsible for ensuring only one instance of itself exists
    Constructor is private
    A static methond or property to return the only instance of itself
    Prefer lazy instantiation
      created when it's requested for the first time
      later requests return same instance
      use Lazy<T> creates lazy instantiation in thread safe manner to avoid locking
  Use cases
    Where there must be exactly one instance and accessible from a well-known access point
    When the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing.
      Clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying their code
  Pattern consequences
    strict control over how and when clients access it
    avoids polluting the namespace with global variables
    multiple instances can be allowed without having to alter the clients
    Disadvantage: violates the single responsibility principles
      objects no longer control how they are created
    in modern languages no longer write code like this anymore
      mostly dealt with via an IOC (inversion of control) container
      IOC manages lifetime responsibility
  Related patterns
    Can be implemented as a singleton
    Abstract factory pattern
    builder pattern
    prototype pattern
    State pattern 
      often implemented as singletons
  
Factory Method pattern
  Also known as virtual constructor
  Intent is to define an interface for creating an object but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
  Lets a class defer instantation to subclasses.
  Concreate creator implements creator and overrides the factory method to return an instance of ConcreteProduct
  Use cases
    When a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create
      don't know in advace which type of object will be working with
    When a class want its subclasses to specify the objects it creates
      concrete creator takes responsibility for creating the objects
    When classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses
      want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate
    As a way to enable reusing of existing objects
      creator can crate or reuse and existing object
  Pattern consequences
    Eliminate the need to bind application-specific classes to your code
      because only deals with interface and not the concrete implementation
      avoiding tight coupling
    New type of products can be added without breaking client code
      open/closed principle
    Creating products is moved to one specific place in code, the creator
      single responsibility principle
    Disadvantage: Clients might need to create subclasses of the creator class just to create a particular ConcreteProduct object.
  Related patterns
    Abstract factory
      Often implemented with factory methods
    Prototype
      No subclassing is needed, but an initialize action on Product is often required
    Template
      Factory methods are often called from within template methods
      
Abstract Factory pattern
  Intent
    Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    Using same factory to create related services by composition
  Client is decoupled from the concrete factory implementation
  Use cases
    When a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed and represented.
    When want to provide a class library of products and only want to reveal their interfaces, not their implementations.
    When a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
    When a famility of related product objects is designed to be used together and want to enforce this constraint.
  Pattern consequences
    Isolates concrete classes, because it encapsulates the responsibility and the process of creating product objects.
    New products can easily be introduced without breaking client code: open/closed principle
    Code to create products is contained in one place: single responsibility principle
    It makes exchanging product families easy
    Promotes consistency among products
    Disadvantage: Supporting new kind of products is rather difficult.
  Related patterns
    Factory method
    Prototype
    Singleton
    
Builder pattern
  Intent
    Separate construction of a compplex object from its representation. 
    The same constructiton process can create different representations.
  Creating a complex object is transparent for the consumer of the builder
  Work on interfaces, not implementations.
  Use cases
    When want to make algorithm for creating complex object independent of the parts that make the object and how they're assembled.
    When want the construction process to allow different representations for the object that's constructed.
  Pattern consequences
    Lets us vary a product's internal representation
    Isolates code for construction and representation; thus improves modularity by encapsulationg the way a complex object is constructed and represented: single responsibility principle
    Gives finer control over the construction process
    Disadvantage: Complexity of code base increases
  Related patterns
    Abstract factory
    Singleton
    Composite
    
Prototype pattern
  Intent
    Specify the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this instance.
    Copying existing objects without dependancy on concrete classes.
  A way to create a new object by cloning an existing one
  Prototype class declares an interface for cloning itself
  Use cases
    When a system should be independent of how its objects are created, and avoid building a set of factories that mimics the class hierarchy.
    When a system should be independent of how its objects are created, and when instances of a class can have one of only a few different combinations of states.
  Pattern consequences
    Hides the ConcreteProduct classes from the client, which reduces what the client need to know
    Reduce subclassing
    Each implementation of the prototype base class must implement its own clone method

Adapter pattern
  Intent
    Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
    Lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
  Actors
    Adaptee
      defines an existing interface that needs to be adapted
    Target
      defines the domain specific interface that the client uses
    Adapter
      adapts the interface of Adaptee to the Target interface
  Two types
    Object adapter pattern
      Works with object composition
    Class adapter pattern
      Relies in multiple inheritance to adapt one interface to another
  Use cases
    Whan you want to use an existing class but the interface does not match the one you need
    When you want to create a reusable class (the adapter) that works with classes that don't have compatible interfaces.
    When you need to use several existing subclasses, don't want create additional subclasses for each of them, but still need to adapt the interface.
  Pattern consequences
    A single adapter can work with many adaptees, and can add functionality to all adapteees at once.
    The interface (adapter code) is separated out from the rest of the code: single responsibility principle
    New types of adapters can be introduced without breaking client code: open/closed principle
    The object adapter makes it hard to override adaptee behavior
    Additional complexity is introduced
    
Bridge Pattern
  Intent
    To decouple an abstraction from its implementation so the two can vary independently
    Aims to separate an abstraction of a class from the implementation
    A means to replace an implementation with another implementation without modifying the abstraction
  Abstraction
    A way to simplify something complex
    Handle complexity by hiding the parts we don't need to know about
  Use cases
    When you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation (to enable switching implementations at runtime)
    When abstraction and implementations should be extensible by subclassing
    When you don't want changes in the implementation of an abstraction have an impact on the client
  Pattern consequences
    Decoupling: the implementation isn't permanently bound to the abstraction
    As the abstration and implementation hierarchies can evolve independently, new ones can be introduced such: open/closed principle
    Hide implementation details from clients
    Can focus on high-level logic in the abstraction, and on the details in the implementation: single responsibility principle
    
Decorator pattern
  Intent
    To attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
    Provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
    Sometimes called a wrapper.
  Adding responsibility to a class can be done bny adding an additional method to the class
  We don't want to add reponsibility to a class but to an instance of a class at runtime: an object
  Actors
    Component
      defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically
    ConcreteComponent
      defines an object to which additional responsibilities can be attached
    Decorator
      maintains a reference to a component object, and defines an interface that conforms to component's interface
    ConcreteDecorator
      adds responsibilities to the component
  Use cases
    When you have a need to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically (at runtime) without affecting other objects.
    When you need to be able to withdraw responsibilities you attached to an object
    When extension by subclassing is impractical or impossible ( class is sealed )
  Pattern consequences
    More flexible than using static inheritance via subclassing: responsibilities can be added and removed at runtime ad hoc when needed.
    Split feature-loaded classes until ther's just one responsibility left per class: single responsibility principle
    Increased effor is required to learn the system due to the amount of small, simple classes
    
Composite pattern
  Intent
    To compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
    It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly: as if they all were individual objects.
  Actors
    Component
      declares the interface for objects on the compositions, and contains a common operation
    Leaf
      represents leaf objects in the composition, and has no children.
      it defines behavior for primitive objects in the composition.
    Composite
      stores child components and defines behavior for components having children.
    Client
      manipulates objects in the compositions through the Component interface
  Use cases
    When want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects
    When want to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects
  Pattern consequences
    Makes the client simple
    It's easy to add new kinds of components: open/closed principle
    Disadvantage: can make the overall system too generic
    
Facade pattern
  Intent
    Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. 
    It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
  Actors
    Facade
      knows which subsystem classes are responsible for a request
      delegates client requests to appropiate subsystem objects
    Subsystem class
      implements subsystem functionality
      don't know about the Facade, but they do handle work assgned by it.
  Use cases
    When want to provide a simple interface into a complex subsystem
    When there are many dependencies between a client and the implementation classes of the abstraction.
  Pattern consequences
    Shields clients from subsystems: the number of objects clients have to deal with are reduced
    Promotes weak coupling between the subsystem and its clients, enabling subsystem components to vary without affecting the client: open/closed principle
    Clients are not forbidden to use subsstem classes

Proxy pattern AKA Surrogate pattern
  Intent
    Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object o control access to it
    the problem it solves is one of access control
    Accessing a remote API from an application
      "Add service reference" from VS generates a proxy to interact with an API
    Proxy is responsible for controlling the actual access to the remote API
      contains code that deals with the underlying protocol
      provides an interface identical to the actual call
      can take on the responsibility of executing code before or after calling the API
  Actors
    Subject
      defines the common interface between the RealSubject and the Proxy
    RealSubject
      defines the real object that the proxy respresents
    Proxy
      provides an interface identical to the Subject. It maintains a reference to and controls access to the RealSubject
  Variations
    Remote proxy
      client can communicate with the proxy, feels like a local resource
      usually generated from a service definition: WSDL, OpenAPI specification
    Virtual proxy
      allow creating expensive objects on demand
      performance optimization is a big advantage of this type of proxy
    Smart proxy
      allows adding additional logic around the subject
      like managing caching, or locking access to shared resources
    Protection proxy
      used to control access to an object
  Use cases
    When need to add some form of access control to an actual object
  Pattern consequences
    By proxy type
      Remote
        Hides the fact that an object resides in a different network space
      Virtual
        object can be create on demand
      Smart & Protection
        additional housekeeping tasks can be executed when an object is accessed
    Allows introducing new proxies without changing the client code: open/closed principle
    Added complexity because of additional classes
    Potential performance impact of passing through additional layers
    
Flyweight pattern
  Intent
    Use sharing to support large number of fine-grained objects efficiently.
    It does it by sharing parts of the state between these objects instead of keeping all that state in all of the objects.
  Considerations before choosing the flyweight pattern ( all must be true )
    Does the application use a large number of objects?
    Are storage costs high because of the large number of objects?
    Can most of the object state be made extrinsic ?
    If you remove extrinsic state, can a large group of objects be replaced by relatively few shared objects?
    Does the application doesn't require object identity?
  Actors
    Flyweight
      declares interface ghrough which they an receive and act on extrinsic state
    FlyweightFactory
      creates and manages Flyweights and ensures they are properly shared
    Client
      maintains a reference to flyweights and computes or stores their extinsic state
    Unshared concrete Flyweight
      enables acting on extrinsic state, while having unshareable instrinsic state
      doesn't have state to share
      no storage advantage anymore
  Use cases
    When the application use a large number of objects
    When storage costs are high because of the large amounts of objects
    When most of the objects state be made extrinsic
    When if removing extrinsic state, a large group of objects be replaced by relatively few shared objects
    When the application does not require object identity
  Pattern consequences
    May save a lot of memory when using the pattern for an applicable use case
    Processing costs might go up, but that's typically offsetted by the reduced storage costs
    Pattern is complex and makes the code base more complicated as well
    
Template pattern
  Intent
    To define the skeleton of an algorith in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
    Lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an alogrithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
  Actors
    AbstractClass
      defines abstracct primitive operations that concrete subclasses define to implement steps on an algorithm
      implements a template method defining the skeleton of an algorithm
    ConcreteClass
      implements the primitive operations to carry out subclass-specific steps of the algorithm
  Use cases
    When you want to implement invariant parts of an algorithm only once, and wnat to leave it to subclasses to implement the rest of the behavior.
    When you want to control which part of an algorithm subclasses can vary
    When you have a set of algorithms that don't vary much
  Pattern consequences
    Template methods are fundamental technique for code reuse
    Template methods cannot be changed: the order of methods they call (the skeleton) is fixed
    
Strategy pattern AKA Policy pattern
  Intent
    To define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
    Lets the algorithm vary independently from client that use it.
  Actors
    Strategy
      declares an interface common to all supported algorithms.
    ConcreteStrategy
      Implement the algorithm defined by the Strategy    
    Context 
      uses the Strategy to call the algorithm defined by a ConcreteStrategy
  Use cases
    When many related classes differ only in their behavior
    When need different variants of an algorithm which you want to be able to switch at runtime
    When algorithm uses data, code or dependencies that the clients shouldn't know about
    Whan a class defines many different behaviors which appear as a bunch of conditional statements in its method
      when dealing with large "if then" or "switch" statements
  Pattern consequences
    It offers an alternative to subclassing your context, alternative to inheritance to composition
    New strategies can be introduced without having to change the context: open/close principle
    It eliminates conditional statements
    It can provide a choice of implementations with the same behavior
    Draw back: 
      if client injects the strategy, it must be aware of how startegies differ
      overhead in communication between the strategy and the context
      additional objects are introduced, which increases complexity
    
Command pattern AKA Action or Transaction pattern
  Intent
    encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
    allows to decouple the requester of an action from the receiver
    very common in mobile or rich UI development
  Actors
    Invoker
      asks Command to cary out a request
    Command
      declares an interface for executing an operation
    ConcreteCommand
      defines a binding between a Receiver and an action.
      implements Execute by invoking the corresponding operation(s) on Receiver
    Receiver
      knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request ( like a repository )
    Client
      creates the ConcreteCommand and sets its Receiver
  Use cases
    When you want to parameterize objects with an action to perform
    When you want to support undo
    When you want to specify, queue and execute requests at different times
    When you need to store a list of changes to potentially reapply later on (like after a system crash)
  Pattern consequences
    It decouples the class that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to perform it: single responsibility principle
    Commands can be manipulated and extended
    Commands can be assembled into a composite command
    Existing implementations don't have to be changed to add new commands: open/closed principle
    Negative: complexity increases because an additional layer
    
Memento pattern AKA Token pattern
  Intent
    To capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later, without violating encapsulation.
    Allows to store and restore private field and property values
  Actors
    Memento
      stores the internal state of the originator. 
      The state should be protected agains access by other objects as much as possible
    Originator
      creates Memento with a snapshot of its internal state.
      It also uses the Memento to restore its internal state.
    Caretaker
      keeps the Memento safe, and shouldn't operate on or examine its contents.
  Use cases
    When part of an object's state must be saved so it can be restored later on
    AND when a direct interface to obtaining the state would exponse implementation details and break encapsulation
  Pattern consequences
    It preserves encapsulation boundaries
    It simplifies the originator
    Using mementos might be expensive
    It can introduce complexity to the code
    
Mediator
  Intent
    To define an object, the mediator, that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
    It does that by forcing objects to communicate via that mediator.
    Promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly
    A central object, the mediator, holds references of objects that want to communicate with each other.
    It handles communication between objects.
  Actors
    Mediator
      defines an interface for communicating with Colleague objects
    Colleague
      knows its Mediator and communicates with it instead of with another Colleague
    ConcreteMediator
      knows and maintains its Colleagues, and it implements cooperative behavior by coordinating Colleague objects
      it routes messages between them
  MediatR
    Popular .NET implementation of the mediator pattern made by Jimmy Bougard
    github.com/jbogard/MediatR
  Use cases
    When a set of objects communicate in well-defined but complex ways
    When because an object refers to and communicates with many other objects, the object is difficult to reuse
    When behavior that's distributed between several classes should be customizable without a lot of subclassing
  Pattern consequences
    It limits subclassing
    It decouples colleagues
    It simplifies object protocols
    New mediators can be introduced without having to change the components: open/closed principle
    Disadvantage: it centralizes control, which can make the mediator turn into a monolith
    
Chain of Responsibility pattern
  Intent
    To avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.
    It does that by chaining the receiving objects and passing the request along the chain until an object handles it.
  Actors
    Handler
      defines an interface for handling requests, and optionally implements the successor link
    ConcreteHandler
      handles requests it's responsible for. It can access the successor and potentially pass the request on.
    Client
      initiates the request to a ConcreteHandler object on the chain
  Use cases
    when more than one object may handle a request and the handler isn't known beforehand
    when want to issue a request to one of several objects (handlers) without specifying the receiver explicitly
    when the set of objects that handle a request should be specified dynamically
  Pattern consequences
    it enables reduced coupling & works towards a single responsibility per class
    it adds flexibility in regards to assigning responsibilities to objects
    it does not guarantee receipt of the request
    
Observer pattern AKA Publish-Subscribe or Pub-Sub
  Intent
    to define a one to many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
  Actors
    Observer
      defines an updating interface for objects that should be notified of changes in a Subject
    Subject
      knows its Observers. Provides an interface for attaching and detaching them.
    ConcreteObserver
      store state that must remain consitent with the Subject's state.
      they implement the Observer updating interface to keep state consistent.
    ConcreteSubject
      stores state of interest to ConcreteObserver objects, and sends a notification to its Observers when its state changes
  Use cases
    When a change to one object requires changine others, and you don't know in advance how many objects need to be changed
    When objects that observer others are not necessarily doing that for the total amount of time the application runs
    When an object should be able to notify other objects without making assumptions about who those objects are
  Pattern consequences
    It allows subjects and observers to vary independently: subclasses can be added and change without having to change others: open/closed principle
    Subject and observer are loosely coupled: open/closed principle
    It can lead to a cascade of unexpected updates
      
State pattern AKA Objects for States
  Intent
    To allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
  Actors
    Context
      defines the interface that's of interest to clients. It maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state.
    ConcreteState
      implements behavior associated with a state of the Context
    State
      defines an interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context
  Use cases
    When an object's behavior depends on its state and it must change it at runtime (depending on that state)
    When objects are dealing with large conditional statements that depend on the object's state
  Pattern consequences
    It localizes state-specific behavior and prtitions behavior for different states: single responsibility principle
    New states and transitions can easily be added by defining new subclasses: open/closed principle
    Negative: the number of classes is increased, which adds additional complexity.
    
Iterator pattern
  Intent
    To provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
    It takes the responsibility for traversing out of the aggregate list object and puts it in an iterator object.
  Actors
    Aggregate
      defines an interface for creating an Iterator object
    Iterator
      defines an interface for accessing and traversing elements
    ConcreteIterator
      implements Iterator interface and kkeps track of the current position in the traversal of the Aggregate
    ConcreateAggregate
      implements the Iterator creation interface to return an instance of the proper ConcreteIterator
  Use cases
    When want to access an aggregate object's content without exposing its internal representation
    When want to support multiple ways of traversal for the same aggregate object
    When want to avoid code duplication in regards to traversing the aggregate object
  Pattern consequences
    Interators simplify the interface of the aggregate structure as traversal code is separated out: single responsibility principle
    Can implement new types of aggregate objects and iterators without them interfering with each other: open/closed principle
    Iterators can exist next to each other at the same time on the same collection
    Can be a bit overkill when you only use simple traversals and collections
    
Visitor pattern
  Intent
    To represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. 
    Lets define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
    Adding behavior to classes by adding the behavior to another class, the visitor, which will visit the original classes to execute that behavior.
  Actors
    Element
      defines an accept operation that takes a Visitor as an argument
    ConcreteElement
      implements the accept operation that takes a Visitor as an argument
    ObjectStructure
      enumerates its elements. It may provide an interface to allow a Visitor to visit its Elements. It can be a composite or a collection.
    Visitor
      declares a visit operation for each class of ConcreteElement in the ObjectStructure
    ConcreteVisitor
      implements each operation declared by Visitor
  Use cases
    When an object structure contains many classes of objects with differing interfaces, and you want to perform operations on them that depend on their concrete classes.
    When the classes defining the object structure don't have to change often, but want to define new operations over the structure.
    When you've got potentially many operations that need to be performed on object structure, but not necessarily on all of them.
    Examples
      Document element processing
      Medical records system
      Data structure serialization
      Financial transactions within a financial software system
  Pattern consequences
    It makes adding new operations easy; you can define a new operation by creating a new visitor: open/closed principle
    A visitor can accumulate info on the objects it visits
    A visitor gathers related operations together and separates unrelated ones: single responsibility principle
    Disadvantage: adding a new ConcreteElement class can be hard
    It might require to break encapsulation
    
Interpreter pattern
  Intent
    Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language
    Examples
      LINQ queries, Regular expressions, C# compiler
  Actors
    AbstractExpression
      declares an abstract Interpret operation that is common to all nodes in the abstract syntax tree
    TerminalExpression
      implements an Interpret operation associated with terminal symbols in the grammar
    Context
      contains information that's global to the Interpreter
    Client
      builds or is given the abstract syntax tree which represents a sentence in the language that the grammar defines.
      invokes the Interpret operation
  Use cases
    When there's a language you can interpret, and you can represent statements in the language as abstract syntax trees
    AND when the grammar is simple
    And when the best possible efficiency isn't required
    Examples:
      Command line parsers
      HTML or XML parsing
      Natural language processors, useful in chatbos and virtual assistants
      Mathematical expression evaluation
  Pattern consequences
    It's easy to change and extend the grammar
    It's easy to implement the grammar
    Complex grammars are hard to maintain
