Microsoft Azure Fundamentals test notes:

Azure Blueprint: 
  to manage templates
Application Insights from Azure Monitor:
  allows to detect and diagnose issues across applications and dependencies
  alerts to changes in performance or usage metrics in your web apps
Service tags: 
  used for creating security rules instead of specific IP addresses
Availability Zone: 
  physically separated location winthin an Azure region, with one or more datacenters
Data Catalog App: 
  component of Microsoft Purview that provides data curation features such as business glossary management and automation tagging of data assets with glossary terms
Azure functions: 
  allos code to run as result of an event or change like a message arrival or a stored procedure update
Azure Log analytics: 
  Azure OMS service that monitors on-premises and cloud environments for availability and performance
Azure sovereign regions: 
  regions dedicated to specific sovereign entities and completely isolated from the rest of Azure: China 21Vianet and US Government
Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure Cloud Shell: 
  can automate routine operations, standarize DB failovers and pull data for insights
Azure Spot VM:

Azure load balancer: 
  operates at OSI layer 4, the Transport Layer
GRS, Geo-redundant storage: 
  designed at 99.999...(16) durability over a year by replicating to a secondary region hundred of miles away from primary region
Azure Table: 
  non-relational to store schemaless data
Azure private peering: 
  bi-directional connectivity between your core network and Azure virtual networks (VNets) that allows to connect VMs and cloud services to your private IP addresses
When scaling down VMs, Azure removes VMs with highest IDs first
Action Group: 
  created within Azure Monitor to notify via e-mail, SMS, push or voice mail notifications
Elasticity 
  is done automatically vs Scalability
Logic Apps: 
  serverless solution that configures workflows and choreographs processes
Event Grid: 
  serverless solution that directs and orchestrates events that can spark code or logic execution. It's an event routing service.
Serveless computing 
  delivers exact units of resources when an application needs it.
