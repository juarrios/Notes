Azure storage accounts
  Storage account
    provides unique namespace for Azure Storage data accessible from anywhere in the world
    when creating storage account should pick storage account type
    account type determines storage services and redundancy options
      Standard general purpose
        Blob, Queue, Table and Azure Files
      Premium block blobs
      Premium file shares
      Premium page blobs
  Storage account endpoints
    Have a unique namespace in Azure for data
    Combination of account name and storage service froms the endpoints
    Storage account names
      Between 3 and 24 characters
      Unique in Azure
    Endpoint format for Azure storage services
      Blob        https://<account-name>.blob.core.windows.net
      Date Lake   ...dfs...
      Azure Files ...file...      
      Queue       ...queue...
      Table       ...table...
Azure storage redundancy
  Storing multiple copies of data to ensure availability and durability in the face of failures
  Factors that help determine redundancy options
    How data is replicated in primary region
    Whether data replicated in second region
    Whether application requires read access to second region
  Redundancy in the primary region
    Always replicated three times in primary region with two options
      Locally redundant storage (LRS)
        Replicate 3 times within a single data center in primary region
        Provides 11 nines of durability 99.9999999% in a year
        Lowest cost option
      Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
        replicates accross three availability zones in primary region
        provides 11 nines in a year
        data accessible even if a zone becomes unavailable
        recommended for high availability
  Redundancy in a secondary region
    For applications requiring high durability
    Paired secondary region based on Azure Region Pairs
    Data in secondary region not available unless there's a failover
    Recovery point objective (RPO)
      point in time to which data can be recovered
      typically less than 15 minutes
    Get-redundant storage (GRS)
      Copies 3 times in primary LRS and three times in a secondary LRS
      provides 16 nines in a year
    Geo-zone redundant storage
      In primare with ZRS and replicated in secondary with LRS
      provids 16 nines in a year
  Read access to data in secondary region
    Has to be enabled for read only access
    creates RA-GRS or RA-GZRS
    Data in secondary might not be up to date due to RPO
Azure storage services
  Benefits
    Durable and highly available
      Redundancy ensures data is safe
    Secure
      All data encrypted and fine grained control over who has access
    Scalable      
    Managed
      Azure handles hardware maintenance, updates and critical issues
    Accessible
      from anywhere in the world
      client libraries support
      scripting support in PowerShell and CLI
      Azure portal and Azure Storage Explorer are visual solutions
  Azure Blobs
    Can store massive amounts of unstructured data such as text and binary
    can manage thousands of simultaneous uploads
    data uploaded as blobs and Azure takes care of storage needs
    Ideal for
      serving images or documents
      storing files for distributed access
      streaming video and audio
      backup and restore, disaster recovery and archiving
      data for analysis
    Blob storage tiers
      organize data on attributes like frequency of access or retention period
      Access tiers to store data in the most cost-effective manner
        Hot access tier
          for data that is accessed frequently
        Cool access tier
          infrequntly accessed data and stored for at least 30 days
        cold access tier
          infrequntly accessed data and stored for at least 90 days
         archive access tier
          rarely access data and stored for at least 180 days
  Azure Files
    Fully managed file shares in the cloud
    Standard Message Block (SMB) and Network File System (NFS) protocols
    Benefits
      shared access
      fully managed
      scripting and tooling
      resiliency
        always available
      familiar programmability
        access data via file system I/O APIs
        also Azure Client Libraries and Azure Storage REST API
  Azure Queues
    For storing large number of messages accessible from anywhere
    Messages up to 64K in size
    can be combined with Azure Functions to take an action when a message is received
  Azure Disks
    blocl-level storage volumes for use with Azure VMs
  Azure Tables
    stores large amounts of non-relational structured data
    NoSQL datastore
    
Exercise - Create a storage 
  Create a storage account
    Portal->Create a resource->Categories->Storage->Storage Account->Create
  Work with blob storage
    Create a blob container and upload a picture
    Change the access level of blob
      Select "Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)
    Use browser to look at image
  Summary
    Create storage account
    Add container to storage account
    Upload blob (image) to container
    Change access level
    View in browser

Identify Azure data migration options
  Azure Migrate
    Helps migrate from on-premise environment to the cloud
      Unified migration platform
        A single portal to start, run and track migration
      Range of tools
        Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment
        Azure Migrate: Server Migration
        Integrates with other Azure services and independent software vendor (ISV) offerings
      Assessment and migration
        Azure Migrate hub can assess and migrate on-premise infrastructure
    Azure Data Box
      Helps transfer large amounts of data in a quick, inexpensive and reliable way
      Shipping a proprietary Data Box with 80 terabytes
      Used for import or export data for on-premise or Azure
      entire process tracked end-to-end by Data Box service in Azure portal
      Use cases
        To transfer data sizes > 40TB
        Can be on-time, periodic
Identify Azure file movement options
  Tools to help move or interact with individual files or small file groups
  AzCopy
    CL utility to copy blobs or files to or form storage accounts
    Can upload, download, copy and synchronize files
    Can be configured to move files between cloud providers.
  Azure Storage Explorer
    Standalone GUI app to manage files and blobs
    Uses AzCopy on the background to perform management tasks
  Azure File Sync
    For local Windows server to automatically stay bi-directionally synced with files in Azure
